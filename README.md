In today's competitive restaurant industry, it is crucial for companies to understand the market and target the right audience in order to drive growth and success. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to this problem by utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to cluster Zomato restaurants into segments based on various factors such as cuisine and cost. By understanding the market segments, the company will be able to target the right audience and make data-driven decisions. Additionally, the project will also analyze customer sentiment and reviews, which will account for 40% of the project, to extract valuable insights and identify areas for improvement that can increase customer satisfaction. Overall, this project aims to empower the restaurant industry with a thorough understanding of the market and actionable recommendations for driving business growth.

This project involved analyzing two datasets - restaurant data and reviews data - to gain insights into the restaurant industry and improve their performance.

Overview
* Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and merged the datasets to discover interesting insights about the restaurants that could benefit their owners.
* Applied feature engineering techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) for text data using TF-IDF to clear and vectorize critics' reviews, and sentiment analysis to extract positive, negative, and neutral sentiments and identify key areas of improvement using negative reviews.
* Conducted clustering on restaurant data using cost, rating, and cuisine list as features. Dimensionality reduction using PCA was performed to convert the data to 3 dimensions, and k-means was applied to the 3D PCA data to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Developed five restaurant clusters based on the results: Cafe, Ice Creams and Desserts, International Cuisines, Premium Continental Restaurants, and Local Street/Fast Food.
